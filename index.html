			<p>
			When you or I think about chess, what pieces do we picture? What pieces do people in other countries picture? What did people in the past picture?
			</p>
			<p>
			Where do chessmen come from? Why do they look like that? Why don't they all look alike? What do different antique chess sets look like? What's with those pieces Beth Harmon was playing with in <em>The Queen's Gambit</em>?

								<p>By the 7th Century CE, people in India were playing <em>chaturanga</em> ("four divisions"). The name refers to four types of solider that made up the game&mdash;infantry, cavalry, elephants, and chariots.</p>
								<p>Chaturgana spread outwards from India and is thought to be the common ancestor of many similar games, including chess and shogi.</p>
								<p>In the Second Persian Empire, <em>chaturanga</em> becomes <em>shatranj</em>. As <em>shatranj</em>, new rules are introduced that cause the game to begin to resemble modern chess, including the rule that the king cannot be captured but must be rendered helpless: shah mat, the king is helpless, gives us the word checkmate.</p>
								<p>The earliest <em>shatranj</em> pieces found are figural. Later, most pieces became abstract/symbolic.</p>

							<h2>Afrasiab</h2>
							
							<p>The earliest <em>shatranj</em> pieces are thought to be figurative, like those discovered in <a class="footnote increment" title="Samarkand State Museum Reserve. Photo ACDF of Uzbekistan." href="#footnotes">Afrasiab</a>, modern Uzbekistan, made from ivory and dating from the 700s. They feature soldiers on foot, horseback or riding chariots or elephants.</p>

							<p>The Afrasiab chessmen are normally considered the oldest definitive chessmen. While there followed a shift in favour of abstract pieces, they must not have been completely replaced as later examples of Islamic figurative pieces have been found.</p>

							<h2>Abstract Persian</h2>
							
							<p>The shift to abstract chessmen has traditionally been attributed to religious aniconism: the prohibition of figurative objects to prevent idolatry. However, not only have later figural pieces been found, but per the Met, abstract Persian chessmen are now thought to predate the Islamic conquest. Perhaps the adoption of symbolic chessmen were to make them easier to distinguish in games, or cheaper to manufacture?</p>
							
							<p><em>Shah</em> and <em>firzan</em> (king and queen) are represented by a large and small throne. The <em>fil</em> (elephant, i.e. bishop) is represented with two tusks, the <em>faras</em> (knight) with one and the <em>rukh</em> (chariot, i.e. rook) with a cleft.</p>

							<p>Although they have a simple silhouette, many of these pieces have been found adorned with intricate designs.</p>

							<h2>Charlemagne</h2>
							
							<p>Later, Europeans began to carve their own figural pieces. One of the earliest extant examples are the <a title="Bibliothèque Nationale." class="footnote increment" href="#footnotes"><em>Charlemagne</em></a> chessmen. Although legendarily associated with Charlemagne, these chessmen are thought to date from about 200 years later. It was gifted to the French monarchy and ended up in the Treasury of Saint-Denis.</p>

							<p>Carved from ivory in Salerno, Italy, in the 11th century, the set features Norman-Sicillian-style warriors and other figures. The king and queen (who replaces the vizier) are depicted in elaborate pavilions.</p>

							<p>It is hard to imagine that such elaborate figural sets--with this one being seen as so precious as to be kept with the French crown jewels--represent sets that were commonplace for play, however.</p>

							<p>These pieces are known for their caricature-like figures with funny, expressive faces. Queens sit on their thrones looking bored, while warders (rooks) gnaw on their shields.</p>

							<div class="accordion_content">												
								<p>Over time in Europe, some pieces became reinterpreted.</p>

								<h3>Queens:</h3>
								
								<p>By the time of the Charlemagne set, the vizier piece has become a queen.</p>

								<p>A simple explanation is that her queenliness was suggested by her proximity to the king. <a href="#footnotes" class="footnote increment" title="Davidson H A (1949). ch 3 Female of the Species in A Short History of Chess. Greenberg New York.">Davidson says</a> the change was due to homophony between <em>fierge</em> (counsellor) and <em>vierge</em> (maiden), writing "she owes her title to accident of sound." He has it that <em>maiden</em> became the Virgin Mary and the "queen of angels"--but he also believes it only happened in the 15th-16th Century while the piece was definitely depicted as a queen long before then.</p>
								
								<p>The queen only later aquires her long-range moveset and becomes the most powerful piece in the late 15th Century. <a class="footnote increment" title="Yalom, M (2004). ch 2, 7, 11 in Birth of the Chess Queen: A History. Rivers Oram Press." href="#footnotes">Feminist scholar Marilyn Yalom</a>	connects this with the cult around the Virgin Mary and Queen Isabella I of Castile. Yalom also suggests the 10th Century Holy Roman Empresses Adelaide of Burgandy and her daughter-in-law Theophanu as inspirations for vizier's transmutation.</p>

								<h3>Bishops:</h3>
								
								<p>While the Charlemagne set features figurative elephants, by the Lewis set the elephants have become bishops, as the two "tusks" of the elephant pieces were reinterpreted as a bishop's mitre. This explanation appears to satisfy everyone.</p>

								<p>In French, the bishop is the <em>fou</em>, <em>fool</em> as in court jester. He  remains an elephant (<em>слон</em>, <em>slon</em>) in Russia.</p>

								<h3>Rooks:</h3>
								
								<p>The chariots of the Charlemagne set become sword-and-shield wielding warriors in the Lewis set, but would later be reimagined as towers.</p>

								<p>A popular explanation given for this is that <em>rukh</em> was equated with either Medieval Latin <em>rocca</em> or Italian <em>rocco</em> meaning tower, and indeed in modern Italian <em>rocco</em> means both <em>rock</em> and <em>fortress</em>. However, <a href="#footnotes" title="Ròcco. Vocabolario on line. Treccani." class="footnote increment">Treccani</a> asserts <em>rocco</em> first arrived in Italian meaning the chessman, from the Persian <em>rukh</em>, and only later gained the meaning tower (synonymous with <em>torre</em>). <em>Rocca</em> appears in <a href="#footnotes" title="Rocca. Du Cange." class="footnote increment">Du Cange's Medieval Latin dictionary</a> with the meaning of <em>fortress</em>, but its etymology is unknown.</p>

								<p>Alternatively, <a class="footnote increment" title="Hans Hollander (2017). Cyclopes, Elephants and Chess Rooks. Originally published 2007 in Festscrhift for Götz Pochat." href="#footnotes">Hans Holländer</a> has attributed the origins of the rook-as-tower to Vida's 16th Century poem Scacchia Ludus, where rooks are depicted as war elephants which carried towers on their backs.</p>

							<h2>Selenus</h2>
							
							<p>This pattern has its origins in the early 17th Century, where similar chessmen appear in the illustrations of Gustavus Selenus's 1616 chess manual. It would remain popular in Germany and Northern Europe until the 1850s.</p>
							
							<p>Selenus pieces are slender and delicate chessmen with multiple tiers. Knights have become more clearly horse's heads, and the rook a tower.</p>

							<h2>Dutch</h2>
							
							<p>Slight and delicate. These are normally attributed to the Netherlands, although it is uncertain exactly where and some sets at auction have been speculated to come from Germany or Denmark. </p>
							
							<p>In this pattern, the kings, queens, and bishops appear as slender, 'multi-knopped' columns, distinguished mainly by height. They often have contrasting finials, which  may be bone on an otherwise wooden set. The knights look solemn, and are dramatically arched. Rooks are stylised towers with spires.</p>

							<p>The centre of chess in the 1700s, and Philidor's regular haunt, was the <em>Café de la Régence</em>, Paris. It gives its name to the <em>Régence</em> or <em>Regency</em> pattern chessmen that were popular at the time.</p>

							<p>Though they would fall out of favour for easier to distinguish pieces, they were still popular enough by the early 20th Century to be depicted in Antti Favén's 1913 painting of the Café.</p>

							<p>Urn-shaped stands with dainty stems. Kings with flattened crowns. Queens and bishops with spherical finials (harder to tell them apart). Bishops collars with crimped edges to evoke the biretta, a clergical hat. Knights are figural horse heads: contemporaneous sets with turned knights instead of carved, resembling the bishops and queens, are called <em>Directoire</em> sets. </p>

							<p>The king and queen are adorned with flower-like structures that give rise to slender towers like stamen, inspiring Camaratta's quaint name for these, <em>Petal and Pistil</em>.</p>

							<h2>Dieppe</h2>
							
							<p>Figural carved chessmen were still made alongside turned wooden, ivory and bone pieces.</p>

							<p>Dieppe, the centre of ivory carving in France, was known for producing ivory bust-style chessmen depicting political themes. Opposing kings becoming busts of real people in conflict like Henri IV and Napoleon, and sets depicting different national armies from history</p>

							<p>This 1870s set (<a href="#footnotes" title="Metropolitan Museum of Art accessions 48.174.153a–p" class="footnote increment">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>) represents King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain in the Granada War. As a French set, bishops are normally jesters (French: <em>fous</em>). Knights may have riders, so called "hobby-horse knights."</p>

							<p>Killarney chessmen can be very varied: this is less a specific pattern as much as a designation of antiques by origin&mdash;i.e. chessmen that are also Killarney ware. However, many are slender, with pointed kings finials, rounded queen's finials, flower-bud bishop mitres.</p>

							<h2>Staunton</h2>
							
							<p>The 'just so' story of the <em>Staunton</em> pattern is this: the variety of chessmen designs popular in different parts of Europe had become an obstacle to international chess competitions. The existing styles could be impractical and top-heavy, or players had difficulty distinguishing pieces of unfamiliar sets. Nathaniel Cooke designed a more practical set that so impressed Howard Staunton, chess master, that he put his name to them.</p>

							<p>Cooke was supposedly inspired by London architecture and horses of Classical sculpture the like Elgin/Parthenon Marbles. Variants on the knight design are used to distinguish different antique and collectable <em>Staunton</em> sets. The queen now has her coronet, rather than a ball finial of <em>Upright</em>, <em>St. George</em>, and other antecedent sets. For the <em>Smithsonian</em>, architect <a href="#footnotes" title="Stamp, J. (2013). How the Chess Set Got Its Look and Feel. Smithsonian Magazine." class="footnote increment">Jimmy Stamp writes</a>:</p>

							<blockquote>
							"The work of architects like Christopher Wren, William Chambers, John Soane, and many others inspired the column-like, tripartite division of king, queen, and bishop. A row of Staunton pawns evokes Italianate balustrades enclosing of stairways and balconies."
							</blockquote>

							<p>The original <em>Staunton</em> chessmen were produced by Jaques of London from 1849. Later, other manufacturers produced their own <em>Staunton</em>-style sets. The leading expert on the <em>Staunton</em> pattern is <a href="#footnotes" class="footnote increment" title="Fersht, A. (2018) Jaques and British Chess Company Chess Sets.‎ Kaissa Publications, Cambridge.">Sir Alan Fersht FRS</a>, better known for his work on protein engineering, who has published a couple of guides to Jaques and contemporaneous chess sets.</p>

							<p>Today wood, plastic, and metal sets following the <em>Staunton</em> pattern are cheap and widely available. <em>Staunton</em> became the de facto standard chessmen by the mid-20th Century, and today FIDE officially requires the pattern for tournaments.</p>

							<p>So practical and iconic were the <em>Staunton</em> chessmen that even before they reached total cultural hegemony, the iconic pattern would inform other chessmen designs internationally that responded to or took on features from the pattern. </p></div>

							<h2>Austrian Coffeehouse</h2>
							
							<p>The formidable <em>Austrian Coffeehouse</em> or <em>Old Vienna</em> chessmen, are something of a fusion between the <em>Biedermeier</em> and <em>Staunton</em> patterns, although auction houses seem to use <em>Coffeehouse</em> as more of a catch all for any non-<em>Staunton</em> Central European patterns.</p>

							<p>These became the typical chessmen for games in Vienna and Central Europe from the late 19th until the middle of the 20th Century, when <em>Staunton</em> gradually overtook them. The kings and queens have gear-like crowns. Bishop mitres are usually opposite coloured. </p>

							<h2>Česká Klubovka</h2>
							
							<p>The <em>Česká Klubovka</em>&mdash;Chess Club&mdash;chessmen were designed in Prague in the 1880s by Czech sculptor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohuslav_Schnirch">Bohuslav Schnirch</a>. Writing in 2018, chess collector <a href="#footnotes" class="footnote increment" title="Lanier, N. (2018). Check or Czech? - the Czech Club Pieces. Presented at the 18th CCI World Congress in Prague 2018.">Nicholas Lanier contextualised</a> Schnirch's chessmen as a salvo in a culture war asserting independent Czech national identity.

							<blockquote>
							"But chess was also split along the cultural and language divide... In the course of the [eighteen] eighties Schnirch found it necessary to provide his club with a proper chess set in a different style--the prevalent coffeehouse chess men were a Vienna invention, therefore the oppressors' "chessic" imposition... a new chess set responding to the national spirit of Czech Chess players was needed."
							</blockquote>
							
							<p>The influence of the <em>Staunton</em> design is clear, but with a Czech twist. Opposite-coloured heads or finials, common in Central European sets, are typical for the bishops and often present on the queen and king. The bishops tend not to have a split mitre, but have a grove or flick of colour suggestive of preaching band neckwear. </p>

							<p>The name <em>Knubbel</em> (i.e. <em>Lump</em>) seems to have been coined by a German chess collector website, under the impression the pieces were an exclusively German pattern. In fact, <a href="#footnotes" class="increment footnote" title="Langer & Seiersen (2023). The true origin of the 'Knubbel' sets. Chess Collector 33(3).">research by Langer & Seiersen</a> confirms their Danish origin, emerging by the 1890s. In Denmark they have gone by a few monikers: <em>Copenhagen</em> chessmen, and later <em>Danish-type</em> and the <em>(Danish Chess) Union</em> model. Nevertheless, <em>Knubbel</em> seems to have stuck, in the Anglosphere at least. </p>

Their characterful appearance&mdash;Lanier called them "Roman nosed"&mdash;probably contributes to enduring popularity of <em>Lardy</em> sets: what were once a mass-market pattern is now the subject of premium, luxury reproductions.</p>

Only a small number of sets were originally made, but they became highly sought-after. Updated versions, Dubrovnik II and Dubrovnik Minčeta, were designed and produced in the 1960s.</p>

							<p>The knights have distinctive tucked-in heads. In common with other Communist-era sets, religious symbols like the cross on the king's crown or and groove in the bishop's mitre are missing. Bishops have opposite-coloured finials. Rooks have five merlons (parapets), to evoke the five-pointed star.</p>

							<p>Kings with flattened crowns, queens with bell-shaped or conic heads (a princess's hennin perhaps?) a la <em>Regency</em>. Bishops with cut mitres a la <em>Staunton</em>. Knights with stub-noses, apparently characteristic of Spanish <em>Staunton</em> sets also.</p>

							<h2>Italian mixed material</h2>
							<p>A number of mixed-material designs, where metal bases and finials are connected by wooden or plastic shanks, popular among Italian manufacturers including Italfama and Dal Rossi.</p>
							
							<p>The metal bases and heads and vase-like stems reminds me of the silver and jade <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/faberg%C3%A9-kuropatkin-chess-set-board-and-case-karl-gustav-hjalmar-armfeldt/cQEtIZwdzEOYcQ">Fabergé chess set</a>. </p>

							<p>Italfama use this format&mdash;wooden stems with metal heads&mdash;for several different product lines distinguished by different styles of heads, which their distributors refer to as a "traditional Italian style". Alongside mixed-material sets, they make all-metal pieces with the same profiles. An Italfama all-metal set was used in the final scene of <em>X-Men: The Last Stand</em> (2006).</p>

							<h2>Seville 87</h2>
							<p>Seville in 1987 saw Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov clash in the World Chess Championship. Spanish manufacturer Indajesa supplied the pieces for the games, with the unique rook design modelled on Seville's <em>Torre del Oro</em> commemorating the host city. </p> 
							
							<p>Indajesa later produced reproduction <em>Seville</em> sets with the same rook, but the rook is about all that everyone agrees on. There is some <a href="#footnotes" class="footnote increment" title="Some Chess.com discussion on the Seville set: THE SEVILLA SET ...That is not Sevilla set! and Spanish chess sets ...Seville 87">debate</a> over which is the correct knight: the rumour is that the set originally was concieved with typical Indajesa Spanish-style knights but the players themselves asked for the substitution with <a href="#chavet"><em>Chavet</em>-style</a> knights instead. The reproduction set came with the <em>Chavet</em>-style knights.</p>
							
							<p>On the other hand, the reproduction queen, typical Indajesan style, was certainly wrong, without prongs on her coronet or the orb finial as seen in photos.</p>
							
							<p>Fortunately, the reproduction of the rooks are accurate: the only debate there is over whether the <em>Torre del Oro</em> rooks are charming or ghastly.</p>

							<h2>Zagreb 59</h2>
							
							<p>The <em>Zagreb</em> or <em>Zagreb 59</em> are popular <em>Staunton</em>-mode chessmen known for their uncomfortable-looking knights: horses heads with two ninety degree turns. </p>
							
							<p>From the name, one would think this design is based on the chessmen used in the 1959 Candidates tournament, held in Bled, Zagreb, and Belgrade. This appears to just be marketing: no photo of such pieces from the tournament have surfaced. Rather, photos and <a href="#footnotes" class="footnote increment" title="RTV SLO (1959). MEDNARODNI ŠAHOVSKI TURNIR NA BLEDU. Slovenia. Via EU Screen.">footage</a> from Bled show what appear to be <em>Dubrovnik</em>-pattern pieces.</p>
							
							<p>The <em>Zagreb</em> pattern appears to originate from Frank Camaratta's House of Staunton from the early '00s, which <a href="#footnotes" title="House of Staunton Zagreb '59 series (2003) as archived by web.archive.org." class="footnote increment">originally described them</a> as "accurate reproductions of one of the most popular chess sets used in the major International tournaments during the 1950s and 1960s" made "to commemorate that classic struggle [the 1959 tournament]". Nevertheless they are very popular, and other manufacturers have their own lines with similar broken-back knights under a variety of names like <em>Leningrad</em> or <em>Yugoslavian</em>. </p>

							<h2>World Championship</h2>
							<p>The <em>World Championship</em> set, designed by Daniel Well for the 2013 Candidates Tournament in London, is a glossy, minimalist reinterpretation of the <em>Staunton</em> pattern. It has also been called the <em>Pentagram</em> pattern after Well's design company.</p> 

							<p>This pattern may be especially recognisable to those people who for some reason are more interested in playing chess, rather than collecting chess sets (or indeed, drawing them for an infographic), as it was with these chessmen Magnus Carlsen won the Candidates and defeated Viswanathan Anand to become World Chess Champion. </p>

							<h2>Wobble Chess</h2>
							<p>An art piece or a chess set? Each piece, wood on a chrome ball, functions like a weeble. Played on a special chessboard with concave squares, the pieces will jiggle about whenever moved.</p>

							<p>Toronto company Umbra's <em>Wobble Chess</em> is intentionally impractical, so it is interesting that in the 19th C. German turner Schnmitthenner produced a line of self-righting chessmen where the same self-righting feature is intended to make chess more practical when played on the move. </p>
